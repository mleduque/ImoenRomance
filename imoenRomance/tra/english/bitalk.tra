@9    = ~So you were attracted to her?~
@10   = ~Why not? That would have been awesome!~

@12   = ~(Imoen purses her lips in annoyance) Why're you pushing me?~
@13   = ~You've also never seen me with a girlfriend, you dork! Maybe *you've* got time to go around flirtin' with people and stuff while saving the world, but I sure don't!~

@16   = ~You're right. It's none of my business.~

@29   = ~(She places one hand against your cheek and guides you into a soft, slow kiss that leaves no doubt as to her sincerity. When she pulls away, she smiles and touches her fingertip to your lips.)~
@30   = ~Now hush up, 'kay? I don't even want to *think* of anyone other than you.~

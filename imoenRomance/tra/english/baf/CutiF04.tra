@0   = ~You wake up with Imoen's kiss burning on your lips. The feeling lingers for hours into the day.~
@1   = ~Imoen appeared in my dreams.


I had yet another dream with Imoen last night. Unlike the others, it was unrelated to the Taint - at least, on the surface. It dealt closely with our personal relationship.
She clearly implied that there's more to it than simple friendship. I remember the entire episode like I do any other real memory. Is she reaching out to me, wherever she is? Or is it something far more mundane?
Only time will tell.~

@0   = ~You wake up damp with sweat. There is a faint ache wherever her fingers touched you, and when you bring your hand to your lips, your fingertips return with a faint ashen smudge.~

Imoen, or an image of her, showed up again last night. She was far more direct this time about the nature of our relationship, and once more the episode seemed to bleed into the waking world.

I wonder if these dreams will keep happening until I reach her.~

@0   = ~Imoen's words echo in your head as though she just whispered them in your ear. They convey a sense of urgency that is difficult to ignore.~
@1   = ~A third dream with Imoen.

Imoen's angst plagued my dreams once more. These experiences are getting more intensely real each time they occur. I can still feel her cries of terror, her shudders and sobs. Perhaps they are an echo of what she is suffering in the real world.
She asked me to help her. She begged me to make it stop. Whether she is truly communicating with me, or I'm simply recreating what I imagine she's going through, it's time I find out in person, directly from her. 
I must reach Imoen.~

@2    = ~How much simpler would things be for you if I killed <CHARNAME> right now?~
@3    = ~Ooh, how adorable for you to presume. Perhaps I should show you right now which of us is to wither and rot. (Bodhi leans forward, as if she is about to attack. Her dark eyes gleam with hunger as bloodlust takes over her expression.)~
@4    = ~You have come to retrieve what you think is yours... your power has grown stronger, even without your soul. I warn you; desist now, foolish girl.~

@11   = ~(Bodhi turns to you.)~
@12   = ~You... y-you won't touch a single hair on <CHARNAME>'s head while I still draw breath, you disgusting vampire!~

@26   = ~I feared we had lost you already, Imoen.~
@27   = ~Aye, ye were gone fer sure!~
@28   = ~Thank Arvoreen... I thought that foul creature would attack you, Imoen!~
@29   = ~Me too...~
@30   = ~Glad she didn't. I doubt you'd make it to her if I'm not around to help, y'know. (She smiles in your direction.)~
@31   = ~C'mon, let's kick some undead butt.~

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1.	*** INSTALLATION ***

You will need Throne of Bhaal to play this mod.


You should note that the mod comes is ZIP format. Most versions of windows should be able to extract the file.
Winzip can be used if you need to extract the files another way: http://www.winzip.com/win/en/prod_down.html


Instructions:

1) Place the zip file in your root Baldur's Gate 2 directory (where baldur.exe is), right click and select Extract Here. Then move the zip file to another location.

2) Open your Baldur's Gate 2 folder, and double-click 'setup-imoenRomance.exe' for Windows or setup-imoenRomance.Command for MACOS users .

3) Install the Mod AFTER Any mod that modifies Imoen's dialogue (Imoen Friendship mod and Ascension).

4) Wait for it to install everything, and press enter when it is asked so it will unpack some additional files.

And that's it... you can play the mod now.

If you want to uninstall the mod, just double-click again 'setup-imoenRomance.exe' and press 'U' for uninstall.

Note, do not delete therefore the ImoenRomance folder (this goes for any Weidu installed mod) otherwise you cannot uninstall.



---------------------------------------------------------



2.	*** COMPATIBILITY***
This Mod is fully tested for BG2:EE

It Installs fine on BG2 (Vanilla) but have not tested on this old version of the game, people have reported it works fine.

This mod should be compatible with any and all WeiDU mod's out there. 

It should be compatible with Ascension.

----------------------------------------------------------

3.	*** FAQ ***

1. Isn't Imoen your sister?
She is as closely related to you as you are to Sarevok.

2. Who will Imoen romance?
Anyone, regardless of gender or race, but she does differentiate between sex in dialogue.

3. Anything I should know when playing the romance?
The issue of being siblings, her coming off the torture of Irenicus, means unlike the vanilla romance (ok Aerie is an exception) simply coming onto her
at the first opportunity is not a good idea, instead try to be understanding, or basically you know, treat her like someone who has just gone through
torture.

One thing to note is that at a certain point in time, which Imoen will give you the heads up, you need to set the 'scene' and talk to her.

In terms of Gameplay, basically this mod run's like Aerie/Jaheira/Viconia Romance + Flirt Pack.

4. Are there flirts?
Yes, just like the other romance mods and flirt packs, after your a couple you can initiate flirts with her.
There is alot of them, and they are governed differently by factors such as time of day, location etc.

5. Any TOB content?
Yes the Mod is complete with TOB content.

6. What are the Romance variables to watch out for?
ImoenRomanceActive: 1=Romancing, 2=Success, 3=Failed romance and Imoen is angry,
4=Imoen is just a friend, 5=Failed romance but she is on good terms with you 

7. Can i uninstall an older version of this mod and install this one without problems?
Yes, however the older version that is compatible with this version is anything from 2.x, NOT 1.2 (which
was an old discontinued Mod of Lord Mirrabo).

----------------------------------------------------------



4.	*** CHANGES FROM 1.2 ORIGINAL VANILLA MOD ***

This is mainly for those who've played the original mod and want to know the changes or interested in how they came about,
which may be important if your going into the mod thinking its exactly like the original in all aspects.

As Background, Lord Mirrabo created the original mod, which was amazing, however no TOB section was done,
the mod languished for quite awhile until a very charitable and skilled writer, TCDale, offered to
do the TOB section, however her writing style was different to Lord M and so she decided to re-write Lord M's dialogue
and do a complete Mod.

Unfortunately TCDale didn't manage to get a coder to help her complete the mod, so while she completed the SOA dialogue portion, the mod
then languished again.

So then after a few years Vanatos (or me currently) picked it up, discovered that Lord M's scripting was a horrid mess to navigate
and read (no effense Lord M) and the beta for TCDale's mod was vastly incomplete in terms of content, also lots of bugs, I decided to write the scripts from scratch.

So what's changed?

From a Gameplay Perspective~

Player-initiated dialogue's is relegated to the flirts in SOA, the plot-talks during the romance are all timer-driven

From a Content Perspective~

All of TCDales and Lord Mirrabo's content is there, which in comparison to the original, has somewhat more content and is not missing anything from the original.

Also all the 'ridiculous crazy' dialogue, that tended to break immersion, has been removed, or re-written.

TOB content has been done
